### App Store Status

Bibliio is still in the submission process. As soon as it's uploaded, this will be updated.


### To Do

For the next build
- Refactor to MVVM. VCs feel bloated, should be decoupled from model. Considering RxSwift for binding
- Fix custom reminders
- Edit book details after having created a book.
- other changes to come
